# RISC-V-
It is a c procedure to implement on RISC V.

   The RISC-V Instruction Set  Manual    Volume I: User-Level ISA       Version 2.1

   This is version 2.1 of the document describing the RISC-V user-level architecture. Note the frozen user-level ISA base and extensions IMAFDQ version 2.0 have not changed from the previous version     of this document [30], but some specification holes have been fixed and the documentation has been improved.  Some changes have been made to the software   conventions.
  
  my purpose is to use c to describe it.
